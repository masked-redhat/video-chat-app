# Video chatting application

You can set your username to be anything, that's how you will be seen on the application

The user pool is right now 50. That means only 50 users with username can talk at the same time.

Calling is not done by acceptance (right now) but by just someone calling you

You cannot add call, until you end one, if you are on the call.

There is no video conferencing.

This project was made by me, to learn about react js and webrtc and web sockets and how to connect these three together.
